Palawan Hardware
================

Palawan is a pair of boards based on the Kinetis KW01 Sub-GHz radio.

There is a Transmitter board that contains many bare inputs, designed to be
connected to GPIO buttons and act as an input device.

There is also a Receiver board that receives these transmissions and
communicates with a host PC over bit-banged USB.

This repo contains Palawan hardware files.
